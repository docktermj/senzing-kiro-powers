## Cost and Licensing Guidance

### DSR (Data Source Record) Pricing Model

Senzing uses a DSR-based pricing model:

- **DSR Definition**: One record from one data source
- **Example**: If you load 1 million customer records from a CRM system, that's 1 million DSRs
- **Multiple Sources**: Loading the same entity from 3 different sources = 3 DSRs

### Evaluation Limits

- **Free Evaluation**: 500 DSRs (records) for testing
- **Purpose**: Proof of concept, evaluation, learning
- **Limitation**: Cannot be used for production workloads

### When to Contact Sales

Contact Senzing sales when:
- You need to load > 500 records
- You're ready for production deployment
- You need enterprise support
- You require custom configuration or tuning
- You have questions about pricing for your use case

### When to Self-Serve

You can self-serve for:
- Initial evaluation (< 500 records)
- Learning and training
- Development and testing with sample data
- Proof of concept demonstrations

### Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Deduplicate before loading**: Remove duplicates in source data
2. **Load only necessary fields**: Don't load attributes you won't use for matching
3. **Consolidate data sources**: Fewer sources = lower DSR count
4. **Archive old records**: Remove records no longer needed for matching

### Licensing Resources

- **Pricing information**: Use `search_docs` with category "pricing"
- **Sales contact**: https://senzing.com/contact

## Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Batch Processing Pipeline

```
Source System → Extract → Transform → Map (mapping_workflow) → 
Validate (lint_record) → Load (Senzing) → Export Results
```

**Use cases**: Nightly data loads, data migration, periodic deduplication

**Key considerations**:
- Schedule during off-peak hours
- Use multi-threading for large volumes
- Disable redo during initial load
- Monitor for failures and retry

### Pattern 2: Real-Time Streaming

```
Event Stream (Kafka/Kinesis) → Consumer → Map → 
Load (Senzing) → Publish Results → Downstream Systems
```

**Use cases**: Real-time fraud detection, live customer 360, KYC onboarding

**Key considerations**:
- Handle backpressure
- Implement error queues (dead letter queue)
- Monitor lag and throughput
- Use connection pooling

### Pattern 3: REST API Integration

```
Client Application → REST API → Senzing SDK → 
Database → Response → Client
```

**Use cases**: Interactive applications, search interfaces, data stewardship

**Key considerations**:
- Implement rate limiting
- Cache frequently accessed entities
- Use async processing for loads
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes

### Pattern 4: Database Triggers

```
Source Database → Trigger (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) → 
Queue/Message Bus → Senzing Loader → Entity Repository
```

**Use cases**: Change data capture, real-time synchronization

**Key considerations**:
- Keep triggers lightweight
- Use async processing
- Handle trigger failures gracefully
- Monitor trigger performance

### Pattern 5: Microservices Architecture

```
Multiple Services → Message Bus → Senzing Service → 
Entity Repository → Query Service → Consumers
```

**Use cases**: Large-scale distributed systems, cloud-native applications

**Key considerations**:
- Service discovery and registration
- Health checks and monitoring
- Distributed tracing
- Circuit breakers for resilience

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

**What to test**:
- Data mapping logic
- Record validation
- Error handling
- Configuration management

**Tools**:
- pytest (Python)
- JUnit (Java)
- NUnit (C#)
- cargo test (Rust)

**Example test cases**:
```python
def test_record_has_required_fields():
    record = create_test_record()
    assert "DATA_SOURCE" in record
    assert "RECORD_ID" in record

def test_attribute_mapping():
    source_record = {"full_name": "John Smith"}
    mapped = map_record(source_record)
    assert mapped["NAME_FULL"] == "John Smith"
```

### Integration Testing

**What to test**:
- End-to-end data flow
- SDK initialization and configuration
- Database connectivity
- Record loading and retrieval
- Entity resolution accuracy

**Approach**:
1. Set up test database (SQLite for speed)
2. Load known test data
3. Verify expected entity resolution
4. Clean up after tests

**Example test cases**:
```python
def test_entity_resolution():
    # Load two records that should match
    load_record(record1)
    load_record(record2)
    
    # Verify they resolved to same entity
    entity1 = get_entity_by_record_id(record1)
    entity2 = get_entity_by_record_id(record2)
    
    assert entity1.entity_id == entity2.entity_id
```

### Performance Testing

**What to test**:
- Loading throughput (records/second)
- Query response times
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk)
- Scalability (how performance changes with data volume)

**Approach**:
1. Define performance requirements
2. Create representative test data
3. Measure baseline performance
4. Test with increasing load
5. Identify bottlenecks

**Metrics to track**:
- Records loaded per second
- Average query response time
- 95th percentile query response time
- CPU utilization
- Memory usage
- Database size growth

### Data Quality Testing

**What to test**:
- Feature coverage (% records with each attribute)
- Data completeness
- Data consistency
- Match quality (precision and recall)

**Tools**:
- `analyze_record` for coverage analysis
- `why_entities` for match analysis
- Custom scripts for quality metrics

**Example checks**:
```python
def test_data_quality():
    analysis = analyze_records(test_file)
    
    # Check feature coverage
    assert analysis["NAME_FULL_coverage"] > 0.95  # 95%+ have names
    assert analysis["EMAIL_ADDRESS_coverage"] > 0.80  # 80%+ have emails
    
    # Check for placeholder values
    assert analysis["placeholder_count"] == 0
```

### Match Quality Validation

**What to test**:
- True positives (records that should match do match)
- False positives (records that shouldn't match but do)
- False negatives (records that should match but don't)

**Approach**:
1. Create golden dataset with known matches
2. Load data into Senzing
3. Compare Senzing results to golden dataset
4. Calculate precision and recall

**Metrics**:
- **Precision**: % of Senzing matches that are correct
- **Recall**: % of true matches that Senzing found
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

## Glossary

### Core Concepts

**Entity**: A real-world person, organization, or thing. Senzing resolves multiple records into entities.

**Record**: A single data entry from a data source. Multiple records can resolve to one entity.

**Data Source**: A system or dataset that provides records (e.g., "CUSTOMERS", "VENDORS").

**Record ID**: Unique identifier for a record within a data source.

**Entity ID**: Senzing-assigned unique identifier for a resolved entity.

**Resolution**: The process of determining which records refer to the same real-world entity.

### Matching Concepts

**Feature**: An attribute used for matching (e.g., name, address, phone).

**Principle**: A matching rule (e.g., "same name and same address").

**Candidate**: A potential match that Senzing evaluates.

**Match Level**: The strength of a match (e.g., resolved, possibly related, possibly same).

**Match Key**: The specific features that caused records to match.

**Match Score**: Numeric confidence in a match (0-100).

### Data Mapping

**Attribute**: A Senzing field name (e.g., NAME_FULL, PHONE_NUMBER).

**Feature Type**: Category of attribute (e.g., NAME, ADDRESS, PHONE).

**Mapping**: The process of transforming source data to Senzing JSON format.

**Validation**: Checking that mapped data conforms to Senzing requirements.

### Operations

**Loading**: Adding records to Senzing for resolution.

**Redo Processing**: Re-evaluating entities when new data arrives.

**Why Analysis**: Understanding why records matched or didn't match.

### Error Handling

**Error Code**: Senzing error identifier (e.g., SENZ0005).

**Exception**: Programming language error object.

**Retry Logic**: Automatically retrying failed operations.

**Dead Letter Queue**: Storage for records that failed to process.

### Deployment

**POC (Proof of Concept)**: Small-scale test deployment.
