# Senzing Boot Camp Power - Power Builder Assessment
## Date: 2026-03-26

## Assessment Using "Build a Power" Guidelines

This assessment evaluates the senzing-bootcamp power against the Power Builder best practices and guidelines.

---

## Power Type Classification

### ✅ Guided MCP Power

**Correct Classification**: YES

The senzing-bootcamp power is correctly structured as a **Guided MCP Power** because:
- ✅ Has `mcp.json` file with MCP server configuration
- ✅ Connects to Senzing MCP server at `https://mcp.senzing.com/mcp`
- ✅ Provides comprehensive documentation in POWER.md
- ✅ Includes steering files for complex workflows
- ✅ Documents MCP tools and their usage

**Power Builder Guideline**: "Guided MCP Powers include MCP server configuration (mcp.json) plus documentation"

**Assessment**: EXCELLENT ✅

---

## Frontmatter Compliance

### ✅ Frontmatter Format

```yaml
---
name: "senzing-bootcamp"
displayName: "Senzing Boot Camp"
description: "Comprehensive guided boot camp for Senzing entity resolution. Covers data mapping, SDK setup, loading, performance testing, security hardening, monitoring, and production deployment."
keywords: ["senzing", "bootcamp", "training", "tutorial", "learning-path", "entity-resolution", "guided-workflow"]
author: "Senzing"
---
```

**Compliance Check**:
- ✅ `name`: Correct format (lowercase kebab-case)
- ✅ `displayName`: Clear, professional title
- ✅ `description`: Clear, comprehensive (within 3 sentences guideline)
- ✅ `keywords`: 7 relevant keywords (recommended 5-7)
- ✅ `author`: Specified
- ✅ No invalid fields (version, tags, repository, license)

**Power Builder Guideline**: "Only these 5 fields exist: name, displayName, description, keywords, author"

**Assessment**: PERFECT ✅

---

## mcp.json Compliance

### ✅ MCP Configuration Format

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "senzing-mcp-server": {
      "url": "https://mcp.senzing.com/mcp",
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": [],
      "timeout": 60000,
      "env": {
        "SENZING_MCP_LOG_LEVEL": "INFO"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Compliance Check**:
- ✅ Uses remote (HTTP/SSE) MCP server with `url`
- ✅ No metadata in mcp.json (correctly in POWER.md frontmatter)
- ✅ Proper server configuration
- ✅ No API keys or tokens needed (public server)
- ✅ Timeout specified
- ✅ Environment variables for logging

**Power Builder Guideline**: "Never include display metadata in mcp.json (goes in POWER.md frontmatter)"

**Assessment**: EXCELLENT ✅

---

## Power Granularity

### ✅ Single Power Approach

**Decision**: Single comprehensive power

**Rationale**:
- All modules are part of a progressive learning path
- Users work through modules sequentially
- Modules build on each other
- No independent workflows that would benefit from splitting

**Power Builder Guideline**: "Default: Single Power is Best. Only split if there's a very strong conviction that it will significantly improve usability."

**Assessment**: CORRECT ✅

The power correctly stays as a single comprehensive boot camp rather than splitting into multiple powers (e.g., "senzing-bootcamp-beginner", "senzing-bootcamp-advanced"). This is the right decision because:
- Modules are interdependent
- Users progress through a learning journey
- Splitting would create confusion about which power to use
- Single power provides complete context

---

## File Structure

### ✅ Pattern B: Multiple Workflow Power

**Structure**:
```
senzing-bootcamp/
├── mcp.json                    # MCP server config
├── POWER.md                    # Overview + common patterns (880 lines)
├── steering/                   # Dynamic content (16 files)

└── scripts/                    # Utility scripts
```

**Power Builder Guideline**: "Pattern B: Use when POWER.md >500 lines OR independent workflows OR progressive discovery needed"

**Assessment**: EXCELLENT ✅

The power correctly uses Pattern B because:
- ✅ POWER.md is 880 lines (exceeds 500 line threshold)
- ✅ Has 16 steering files for on-demand loading
- ✅ Steering files cover independent topics (cost estimation, security, docker, etc.)
- ✅ Progressive discovery - agents load only what's needed
- ✅ Context preservation - not all content loaded at once
