# License Documentation Improvements

**Date**: 2026-03-26  
**Issue**: Bootcamp lacked clear guidance on obtaining Senzing licenses  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Completed

---

## Problem Statement

The senzing-bootcamp power did not provide adequate information about:
- How to obtain a Senzing license
- Contact information for Senzing support/sales
- Difference between evaluation and production licenses
- Where to place license files
- What to do if you don't have a license

**Impact**: Bootcampers would reach Module 5 (SDK Setup) and be blocked without knowing how to proceed.

## Solution Implemented

Implemented all 4 recommendations to provide comprehensive license information:

### 1. ✅ Created `licenses/README.md`

**File**: `senzing-bootcamp/licenses/README.md`

**Contents**:

- Step-by-step instructions for evaluation licenses
- Contact information (email, phone, website)
- License file placement instructions
- Verification procedures
- Troubleshooting common license issues
- FAQ section
- Security best practices (git ignore)

**Key Information Provided**:
- **Evaluation License**: Free, contact support@senzing.com, 1-2 business days
- **Production License**: Contact sales@senzing.com, pricing based on DSRs
- **Contact**: +1 (702) 425-7756
- **Placement**: `licenses/g2.lic` in project directory

---

### 2. ✅ Updated FAQ with Detailed License Information

**File**: `senzing-bootcamp/docs/guides/FAQ.md`

- Provided step-by-step instructions for obtaining evaluation license
- Added contact information (email, phone, website)
- Referenced `licenses/README.md` for complete guide

**Before**:
```markdown

For Modules 5+, you'll need a Senzing license. Place it in `licenses/g2.lic`.
```

**After**:
```markdown
**Module 0**: No license required
