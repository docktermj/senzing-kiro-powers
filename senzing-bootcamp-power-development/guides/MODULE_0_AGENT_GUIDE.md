# Module 0 Agent Guide: Running the Live Demo

**Quick Reference for Agents**

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for agents running Module 0 (Quick Demo) with the new live demonstration feature.

## Critical Requirements

🚨 **MUST DO**: Actually run the Senzing SDK - don't just describe what would happen  
🚨 **MUST SHOW**: Match explanations with confidence scores  
🚨 **MUST DISPLAY**: Before/after comparison (5 records → X entities)  
🚨 **GOAL**: Create the "aha moment" that proves the technology works  

## Quick Start Checklist

- [ ] Check if Senzing SDK is available
- [ ] Choose demo type based on availability (live SDK, Docker, or simulation)
- [ ] Show sample records BEFORE resolution
- [ ] Run the appropriate demo script (actually execute it!)
- [ ] Display resolved entities AFTER resolution
- [ ] Show match explanations with confidence scores
- [ ] Highlight key insights
- [ ] Connect results to user's use case

## Demo Type Decision Tree

```
START: Module 0 Quick Demo
│
├─ Check: Is Senzing SDK installed?
│  ├─ YES → Use demo_quick_start.py (PREFERRED)
│  │        ✓ Real entity resolution
│  │        ✓ Actual SDK execution
│  │        ✓ True confidence scores
│  │
│  └─ NO → Check: Is Docker available?
│     ├─ YES → Offer Docker option
│     │        Ask: "Would you like to use Docker?"
│     │        ├─ YES → Use demo_quick_start.py with Docker
│     │        │        ✓ Real entity resolution
│     │        │        ✓ No installation required
│     │        │
│     │        └─ NO → Use demo_simulation.py (FALLBACK)
│     │                 ✓ No dependencies
│     │                 ✓ Shows concepts
│     │                 ⚠ Simulated results
│     │
│     └─ NO → Use demo_simulation.py (FALLBACK)
│              ✓ No dependencies
│              ✓ Shows concepts
│              ⚠ Simulated results
```

## Fallback Strategy

When SDK and Docker are unavailable:

1. **Acknowledge the limitation**: "I don't see Senzing SDK installed, and Docker isn't available. Let me show you a simulation instead."

2. **Set expectations**: "This simulation will show you how entity resolution works conceptually. For a live demo with real Senzing SDK, we can set that up later."

3. **Run simulation**: Execute `demo_simulation.py`

4. **Explain simulation**: "This was a simulation showing how Senzing would resolve these records. The actual SDK would provide real confidence scores and more detailed match explanations."

5. **Offer next steps**:
   - "Would you like to install Senzing SDK to see the real thing?"
   - "Would you like to continue with Module 1 using your own data?"
   - "Would you like to set up Docker for a live demo?"

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Check SDK Availability

```bash
# Check if Senzing SDK is installed
python -c "import senzing" 2>/dev/null && echo "SDK found" || echo "SDK not found"
```

**Decision tree**:

1. **If SDK found** → Use `demo_quick_start.py` (preferred path)
2. **If SDK not found** → Check Docker availability:
   ```bash
   docker --version 2>/dev/null && echo "Docker found" || echo "Docker not found"
   ```
   - **If Docker found** → Offer Docker option: "I can run a live demo using Docker (no installation required). Would you like to do that?"
     - If YES → Use `demo_quick_start.py` with Docker
     - If NO → Use `demo_simulation.py` (fallback)
   - **If Docker not found** → Use `demo_simulation.py` (fallback)

**When using simulation fallback**:
- Acknowledge: "I don't see Senzing SDK or Docker available. Let me show you a simulation instead."
- Set expectations: "This simulation demonstrates entity resolution concepts. For a live demo with real Senzing SDK, we can set that up later."
- After simulation: Offer to help install SDK or Docker for a live demo

### 2. Choose Sample Dataset

Ask user which scenario interests them:
- **Las Vegas**: Customer records (retail/hospitality)
- **London**: Person records (identity management)
- **Moscow**: Organization records (B2B)

Default to Las Vegas if user doesn't have a preference.

### 3. Show Sample Records BEFORE Resolution

Display 5 sample records with obvious duplicates:

```
Here are 5 sample records we'll load into Senzing:

Record 1 (CRM_SYSTEM):
  Name:    John Smith
  Address: 123 Main St, Las Vegas, NV 89101
  Phone:   (555) 123-4567

Record 2 (SUPPORT_SYSTEM):
  Name:    J. Smith
  Address: 123 Main Street, Las Vegas, NV 89101
  Phone:   555-123-4567

Record 3 (SALES_SYSTEM):
  Name:    John R Smith
  Address: 123 Main St Apt 1, Las Vegas, NV 89101
  Phone:   (555) 123-4567

Record 4 (CRM_SYSTEM):
  Name:    Jane Doe
  Address: 456 Oak Ave, Las Vegas, NV 89102
  Phone:   (555) 987-6543

Record 5 (SUPPORT_SYSTEM):
  Name:    Jane M. Doe
  Address: 456 Oak Avenue, Las Vegas, NV 89102
  Phone:   555-987-6543

Notice how Records 1, 2, and 3 look like the same person?
And Records 4 and 5 also appear to be the same person?
Let's see if Senzing agrees!
```

### 4. Generate Demo Script

Use MCP server to generate demo script:

```python
# Call generate_scaffold with full_pipeline workflow
generate_scaffold(
    language="python",
    workflow="full_pipeline",
    version="current"
)
```

Save to: `src/quickstart_demo/demo_las_vegas.py`

**IMPORTANT**: Customize the generated script to:
- Use in-memory SQLite database
- Load the 5 sample records
- Query resolved entities
- Display match explanations
- Show before/after comparison

### 5. Save Sample Data

Save sample records to: `src/quickstart_demo/sample_data_las_vegas.jsonl`

Format: One JSON object per line (JSONL)

### 6. Run the Demo

**CRITICAL**: Actually execute the script!

```bash
cd src/quickstart_demo
python demo_las_vegas.py
```

Or with Docker:
```bash
docker run -v $(pwd)/src/quickstart_demo:/data \
  senzing/senzing-tools \
  python /data/demo_las_vegas.py
```

### 7. Display Results

Show the output in this order:

#### a) Summary Statistics
```
Results:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Records loaded:              5
Entities created:            3
Duplicates found:            2 (40% match rate)
Average records per entity:  1.67
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

#### b) Resolved Entities
```
Entity 1: John Smith
Records matched: 3

Record 1 (CRM_SYSTEM):
  Name:    John Smith
  Address: 123 Main St, Las Vegas, NV 89101
  Phone:   (555) 123-4567

Record 2 (SUPPORT_SYSTEM):
  Name:    J. Smith
  Address: 123 Main Street, Las Vegas, NV 89101
  Phone:   555-123-4567

Record 3 (SALES_SYSTEM):
  Name:    John R Smith
  Address: 123 Main St Apt 1, Las Vegas, NV 89101
  Phone:   (555) 123-4567
```

#### c) Match Explanations
```
Match Explanation:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Why these records matched:

Record 1 ↔ Record 2:
  ✓ Name similarity:    92% (John Smith ≈ J. Smith)
  ✓ Address match:      100% (same address, different format)
  ✓ Phone match:        100% (same number, different format)
  ✓ Overall confidence: 98% - STRONG MATCH

Record 1 ↔ Record 3:
  ✓ Name similarity:    95% (John Smith ≈ John R Smith)
  ✓ Address match:      95% (123 Main St ≈ 123 Main St Apt 1)
  ✓ Phone match:        100%
  ✓ Overall confidence: 99% - STRONG MATCH
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 8. Explain the Results

Walk through the resolved entity:

"These 3 records all matched because they share:
- The same name (with variations: John Smith, J. Smith, John R Smith)
- The same address (with formatting differences: Main St vs Main Street)
- The same phone number (with formatting differences)

The 98-99% confidence scores mean Senzing is very certain these are the same person."

### 9. Highlight Key Insights

```
Key Insights:
✓ Senzing automatically recognized duplicates - no manual rules required
✓ Different data formats handled automatically:
    • Phone: (555) 123-4567 ≈ 555-123-4567
    • Address: Main St ≈ Main Street
    • Name: J. Smith ≈ John Smith
✓ Confidence scores show match strength (98-99% = very confident)
✓ This happened in real-time as records were loaded
```

### 10. Connect to User's Use Case

"Now imagine this with your data. Instead of these sample customer records, you'd have [their data sources]. The same process would find duplicates, match records across systems, and give you a unified view. What you just saw is exactly how Senzing will work with your data."

### 11. Transition

Ask what they'd like to do next:
- Start Module 1 with their own data
- Try another sample dataset
- Learn more about entity resolution
- See match explanations in more detail

## Common Issues

### SDK Not Found
**Solution**: Offer Docker option
```bash
docker run -v $(pwd):/data senzing/senzing-tools python /data/demo.py
```

### Demo Script Fails
**Check**:
- Python version (3.8+)
- File paths are correct
- Sample data is in JSONL format

### No Matches Found
**This shouldn't happen** with sample data - the records are designed to match.
If it does happen, check:
- Sample data loaded correctly
- Senzing engine initialized properly
- Records have required fields (DATA_SOURCE, RECORD_ID)

## Agent Behavior Guidelines

### DO
✅ Actually run the Senzing SDK  
✅ Show match explanations with confidence scores  
✅ Display before/after comparison  
✅ Be enthusiastic about the results  
✅ Connect demo to user's use case
