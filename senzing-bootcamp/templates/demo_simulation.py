Senzing Boot Camp - Module 0 Simulation Demo

This demo simulates entity resolution without requiring Senzing SDK installation.
Perfect for when Docker isn't available or SDK installation isn't desired.

IMPORTANT: This is a SIMULATION showing what Senzing would do.
For the real Senzing SDK demo, use the Docker option or install the SDK.
