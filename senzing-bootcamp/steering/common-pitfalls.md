# Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

Learn from common mistakes to save time and frustration.

## Module 0: Quick Demo

### Pitfall: Using `get_stats()` for Record Counts

**Symptom**: `get_stats()` returns `-1` for `loadedRecords` even though records loaded successfully
**Problem**: `get_stats()` tracks per-process workload statistics, not repository totals. It resets after each call.
**Solution**: Track record counts during loading with a simple counter. Use `get_stats()` only for monitoring ongoing operations (Module 9).

## Module 1: Business Problem

### Pitfall: Problem Too Vague

**Symptom**: "I want to clean my data"
**Problem**: Not specific enough to guide the boot camp
**Solution**: Ask targeted questions:

- What specific data quality issue?
- Which systems have the data?
- What's the desired outcome?
- How will you measure success?

### Pitfall: Too Many Data Sources at Once

**Symptom**: User lists 10+ data sources
**Problem**: Overwhelming scope, long timeline
**Solution**: Prioritize 1-2 sources for initial boot camp, expand later

### Pitfall: Unrealistic Expectations

**Symptom**: "This will solve all our data problems"
**Problem**: Entity resolution is powerful but not magic
**Solution**: Set clear expectations about what ER can and cannot do

## Module 2: Identify and Collect Data Sources

### Pitfall: Not Documenting Data Locations

**Symptom**: "Where did we get this file?"
**Problem**: Can't trace data lineage or refresh data
**Solution**: Document all data source locations in `docs/data_source_locations.md`

### Pitfall: Mixing Raw and Transformed Data

**Symptom**: Files scattered across directories
**Problem**: Hard to track what's been processed
**Solution**: Keep raw data in `data/raw/`, transformed in `data/transformed/`

### Pitfall: Loading Entire Large Datasets

**Symptom**: Uploading 10GB files
**Problem**: Slow, unnecessary for evaluation
**Solution**: Create representative samples (1000-10000 records)

## Module 3: Evaluate Data Quality

### Pitfall: Insufficient Sample Data

**Symptom**: User provides 2-3 sample records
**Problem**: Can't assess data quality or patterns
**Solution**: Request 100-1000 sample records minimum

### Pitfall: Skipping Quality Scoring

**Symptom**: "The data looks fine to me"
**Problem**: Subjective assessment, missing quality issues
**Solution**: Always run automated quality scoring to get objective metrics

### Pitfall: Ignoring Data Quality Issues

**Symptom**: "We'll fix the data later"
**Problem**: Poor quality = poor matching results
**Solution**: Address quality issues during mapping (Module 4)

### Pitfall: Accepting Low Quality Scores

**Symptom**: Quality score < 70% but proceeding anyway
**Problem**: Poor matching results, wasted effort
**Solution**: Improve data quality before mapping or adjust expectations

## Module 4: Map Your Data

### Pitfall: Hand-Coding Attribute Names

**Symptom**: Using `BUSINESS_NAME_ORG` instead of `NAME_ORG`
**Problem**: Wrong attribute names cause loading failures
**Solution**: ALWAYS use `mapping_workflow` - never guess

**Common wrong names**:

- ❌ `BUSINESS_NAME_ORG` → ✅ `NAME_ORG`
- ❌ `EMPLOYER_NAME` → ✅ `NAME_ORG`
- ❌ `PHONE` → ✅ `PHONE_NUMBER`
- ❌ `EMAIL` → ✅ `EMAIL_ADDRESS`
- ❌ `SSN` → ✅ `SSN_NUMBER`

### Pitfall: Forgetting Required Fields

**Symptom**: Mapping fails validation
**Problem**: Missing `DATA_SOURCE` or `RECORD_ID`
**Solution**: Every record MUST have:

- `DATA_SOURCE` - Unique identifier for this source
- `RECORD_ID` - Unique within the data source

### Pitfall: Not Testing Transformation

**Symptom**: Running transformation on full dataset first
**Problem**: Errors discovered after hours of processing
**Solution**: Always test on 10-100 records first

### Pitfall: Skipping Quality Analysis

**Symptom**: "The transformation ran, so it's good"
**Problem**: Low quality data = poor matching
**Solution**: Always run `analyze_record` and review metrics

### Pitfall: Losing Mapping Workflow State

**Symptom**: `mapping_workflow` errors about missing state
**Problem**: Not passing the `state` object between calls
**Solution**: Always pass the EXACT `state` JSON from previous response

### Pitfall: Generated Files Placed in Project Root

**Symptom**: `.py`, `.jsonl`, `.md`, `.sh` files appear in project root after mapping
**Problem**: MCP tools may output files to the current directory instead of the proper subdirectory
**Solution**: Always relocate generated files immediately:

- Python mapper scripts → `src/transform/`
- Transformed JSONL output → `data/transformed/`
- Mapping documentation → `docs/`
- Shell scripts → `scripts/`

If files land in the root, move them before proceeding.

## Module 5: Set Up SDK

### Pitfall: Installing Over Existing Installation

**Symptom**: Installation conflicts, version mismatches, broken configuration
**Problem**: Not checking if Senzing is already installed
**Solution**: Always check first:

```bash
# Check Python package
python -c "import senzing; print(senzing.__version__)" 2>/dev/null

# Check installation directory
ls -la /opt/senzing 2>/dev/null

# Check pip
pip list | grep senzing
```

If already installed, verify version and use existing installation.

### Pitfall: Using SQLite for Production

**Symptom**: "SQLite is working fine for 10K records"
**Problem**: Doesn't scale, poor performance at 100K+
**Solution**: SQLite for evaluation only, PostgreSQL for production

### Pitfall: Skipping Anti-Pattern Check

**Symptom**: Following outdated installation guides
**Problem**: Known issues, deprecated approaches
**Solution**: Always call `search_docs` with category `anti_patterns`

### Pitfall: Wrong Platform Commands

**Symptom**: Using apt commands on macOS
**Problem**: Installation fails
**Solution**: Use `sdk_guide` with correct platform parameter

### Pitfall: Missing Environment Variables

**Symptom**: SDK initialization fails
**Problem**: `SENZING_ENGINE_CONFIGURATION_JSON` not set
**Solution**: Follow `sdk_guide` configuration exactly

## Module 6: Load Single Data Source

### Pitfall: No Database Backup

**Symptom**: Loading fails halfway, database corrupted
**Problem**: No way to recover
**Solution**: ALWAYS backup before loading (use backup hook)

### Pitfall: Loading Without Testing

**Symptom**: Errors discovered after loading millions of records
**Problem**: Wasted time, need to rollback
**Solution**: Test load with 100 records first

### Pitfall: Ignoring Error Codes

**Symptom**: "Some records failed but most worked"
**Problem**: Errors indicate data quality or configuration issues
**Solution**: Use `explain_error_code` for every error, fix root cause

### Pitfall: Wrong DATA_SOURCE Name

**Symptom**: Records load but queries don't work
**Problem**: DATA_SOURCE doesn't match registered name
**Solution**: Verify DATA_SOURCE matches Module 5 configuration

### Pitfall: Not Monitoring Progress

**Symptom**: "Is it still running?"
**Problem**: No visibility into loading status
**Solution**: Add progress logging to loading programs

### Pitfall: Loading Multiple Sources Without Orchestration

**Symptom**: Loading sources one by one manually
**Problem**: No dependency management, inefficient
**Solution**: Use Module 7 for multi-source orchestration

## Module 7: Multi-Source Orchestration

### Pitfall: Loading Sources in Wrong Order

**Symptom**: Reference data loaded after dependent data
**Problem**: Missing relationships, poor resolution
**Solution**: Define load order based on dependencies

### Pitfall: No Error Handling Across Sources

**Symptom**: One source fails, entire load stops
**Problem**: All-or-nothing approach
**Solution**: Implement per-source error handling and continue

### Pitfall: Not Tracking Multi-Source Progress

**Symptom**: "Which sources have loaded?"
**Problem**: No visibility into overall progress
**Solution**: Use orchestration dashboard or logging

## Module 8: Query and Validate Results

### Pitfall: Guessing SDK Method Names

**Symptom**: Using `close_export` instead of `closeExport`
**Problem**: Method doesn't exist, code fails
**Solution**: Use `generate_scaffold` or `get_sdk_reference`

**Common wrong methods**:

- ❌ `close_export` → ✅ `closeExport`
- ❌ `close_export_report` → ✅ `closeExport`
- ❌ `whyEntityByEntityID` → ✅ `whyEntities` (V4)

### Pitfall: Wrong Query Flags

**Symptom**: Results missing expected information
**Problem**: Incorrect or missing flags
**Solution**: Use `get_sdk_reference` with topic `flags`

### Pitfall: Not Understanding Why Records Matched

**Symptom**: "These shouldn't have matched"
**Problem**: Don't understand resolution behavior
**Solution**: Use `whyEntities` to see match details and scoring

### Pitfall: Expecting Perfect Results Immediately

**Symptom**: "The results aren't perfect"
**Problem**: First iteration rarely perfect
**Solution**: Iterate - adjust mappings, confidence scores, add attributes

### Pitfall: Skipping UAT

**Symptom**: "It looks good to me, let's deploy"
**Problem**: No stakeholder validation, surprises in production
**Solution**: Always conduct UAT with business users before production

## Modules 9-12: Production Readiness

### Pitfall: Skipping Performance Testing

**Symptom**: "It works on my laptop"
**Problem**: Production performance unknown
**Solution**: Complete Module 9 performance testing before production

### Pitfall: No Security Hardening

**Symptom**: Using default passwords, no encryption
**Problem**: Security vulnerabilities
**Solution**: Complete Module 10 security hardening checklist

### Pitfall: No Monitoring Setup

**Symptom**: "Is the system running?"
**Problem**: No visibility into production health
**Solution**: Complete Module 11 monitoring setup before deployment

### Pitfall: No Disaster Recovery Plan

**Symptom**: Data loss with no backup
**Problem**: Cannot recover from failures
**Solution**: Complete Module 12 DR planning and test backups

## General Pitfalls

### Pitfall: Not Reading Error Messages

**Symptom**: "It's not working"
**Problem**: Error message explains the issue
**Solution**: Read error messages carefully, use `explain_error_code`

### Pitfall: Skipping Documentation

**Symptom**: Guessing how things work
**Problem**: Incorrect assumptions, wasted time
**Solution**: Use `search_docs` liberally

### Pitfall: Not Committing to Git

**Symptom**: Lost work after accidental deletion
**Problem**: No version control
**Solution**: Commit after each module completion

### Pitfall: Working in Production First

**Symptom**: Testing in production environment
**Problem**: Risk of data corruption, downtime
**Solution**: Always develop locally or in dev environment

### Pitfall: Not Documenting Decisions

**Symptom**: "Why did we do it this way?"
**Problem**: Lost context, hard to maintain
**Solution**: Document decisions in docs/ as you go

### Pitfall: Rushing Through Modules

**Symptom**: Skipping validation steps
**Problem**: Errors compound, harder to debug
**Solution**: Complete each module fully before proceeding

## Recovery from Common Mistakes

### Loaded Wrong Data

```bash
# Restore from backup
./src/utils/rollback.sh data/backups/G2C_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.db
```

### Wrong Transformation

```bash
# Delete bad output
rm data/transformed/bad_output.jsonl
# Fix transformation program
# Re-run on sample first
# Validate with lint_record
```

### Lost Mapping State

```bash
# Start mapping workflow over
# Or use saved mapping documentation from docs/
```

### Corrupted Git Repo

```bash
# Restore file from git
git checkout HEAD -- src/transform/program.py
```
