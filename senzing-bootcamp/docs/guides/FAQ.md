# Senzing Boot Camp - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is the Senzing Boot Camp?

The Senzing Boot Camp is a comprehensive, guided learning experience for Senzing entity resolution. It's a structured 13-module curriculum that takes you from understanding your business problem through to production deployment.

### How long does the boot camp take?

It depends on your path:

- **Quick Demo** (Module 0): 10-15 minutes
- **Fast Track** (Modules 5-6): 30 minutes
- **Complete Beginner** (Modules 1-6, 8): 2-3 hours
- **Full Production** (All Modules 0-12): 10-18 hours

### Do I need prior Senzing experience?

No! The boot camp is designed for beginners. Start with Module 0 (Quick Demo) to see entity resolution in action, then work through the modules in order.

### Can I skip modules?

Yes, experienced users can skip modules:

- Have SGES-compliant data? Skip Module 4
- Senzing already installed? Skip Module 5
- Single data source only? Skip Module 7
- Not deploying to production? Skip Modules 9-12

### What's the difference between senzing-bootcamp and senzing powers?

- **senzing-bootcamp**: Structured 13-module learning curriculum with project guidance
- **senzing**: Quick reference documentation and tool catalog

Both connect to the same MCP server. Use bootcamp for learning, senzing for quick reference.

- Original source data: `data/raw/`
- Transformed data: `data/transformed/`
- Sample data: `data/samples/`
- Database backups: `data/backups/`

See `docs/policies/FILE_STORAGE_POLICY.md` for complete details.

## Working with Modules

### How do I know which module I'm on?

Run `./scripts/status.sh` to see:

- Current module
- Progress percentage
- Completed modules
- Next steps

### Can I go back to a previous module?

Yes! The boot camp is iterative. You can revisit earlier modules as you learn more about your data.

### How do I track my progress?

Use `docs/guides/PROGRESS_TRACKER.md` to manually track completion, or install the module completion hooks to auto-track progress.

### What if I get stuck on a module?

1. Check the module prerequisites
2. Review `docs/guides/TROUBLESHOOTING_INDEX.md`
3. Use the MCP tool `search_docs` for specific topics
4. Ask the agent for help
5. Check `steering/common-pitfalls.md`

## Data and Mapping

### What data formats are supported?

- CSV
- JSON/JSONL
- XML
- Database tables
- API responses

The boot camp helps you transform any format to Senzing JSON.

### Do I need to manually map my data?

No! Use the `mapping_workflow` MCP tool in Module 4. It guides you through an interactive 7-step process to map your data correctly.

### What is SGES?

SGES (Senzing Generic Entity Specification) is the JSON format Senzing uses. The `mapping_workflow` tool ensures your data conforms to SGES.

### How do I validate my mapped data?

Use these MCP tools:

- `lint_record`: Validates format and structure
- `analyze_record`: Provides quality metrics
- `search_docs`: Look up attribute definitions

## SDK and Installation

### Do I need to install Senzing locally?

Not for Module 0 (Quick Demo). For Modules 5+, you have options:

- Local installation (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Cloud deployment

Module 5 guides you through installation.

### Which database should I use?

- **SQLite**: Good for evaluation and small datasets (<100K records)
- **PostgreSQL**: Recommended for production and large datasets

Start with SQLite, migrate to PostgreSQL when needed.

## Code and Development

### What programming languages are supported?

The boot camp primarily uses Python, but Senzing SDK supports:

- Python
- Java
- C#
- Rust
- C/C++

Use `generate_scaffold` to create code in your preferred language.

### Do I need to write code?

Minimal coding required! The boot camp uses MCP tools to generate code for you:

- `mapping_workflow`: Generates transformation code
- `generate_scaffold`: Generates loading and query code

You customize the generated code for your needs.

### What are the code quality standards?

All Python code follows PEP-8 standards:

- 100 character line limit
- 4 spaces for indentation
- Proper docstrings
- Organized imports

Install the `pep8-check` hook to auto-check compliance.

### Where should I put my code?

- Transformation programs: `src/transform/`
- Loading programs: `src/load/`
- Query programs: `src/query/`
- Utilities: `src/utils/`
- Scripts: `scripts/`

Never put code in the project root or `/tmp`.

## Hooks and Automation

### What are hooks?

Hooks are automated actions triggered by IDE events. They help maintain quality and remind you of best practices.

### Which hooks should I install?

Recommended hooks:

- **pep8-check**: Ensures code quality
- **backup-before-load**: Reminds to backup
- **data-quality-check**: Validates transformations
- **backup-project-on-request**: Auto-backup on command

Install all hooks: `./scripts/install_hooks.sh`

### How do I disable a hook?

Edit the hook file in `.kiro/hooks/` and set `"enabled": false`, or delete the hook file.

## Backup and Recovery

### How do I backup my project?

Three ways:

1. Say "backup my project" (if backup hook is installed)
2. Run `./scripts/backup_project.sh`
3. Use git for version control

### What gets backed up?

Included:

- Database files
- Data files (raw, transformed)
- Source code
- Configuration files
- License files

Excluded:

- Backups themselves
- Git repository
- Temporary files
- Environment secrets (.env)

### How do I restore a backup?

```bash
./scripts/restore_project.sh backups/senzing-bootcamp-backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.zip
```

Or extract manually:

```bash
unzip backups/senzing-bootcamp-backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.zip -d ~/restore-location
```

### How often should I backup?

Create backups:

- Before starting a new module
- After completing a module
- Before major changes
- Before data reloads
- Weekly during active development

## Performance and Optimization

### How fast is Senzing?

Typical performance:

- Transformation: 10K-100K records/second
- Loading: 1K-10K records/second (depends on hardware)
- Queries: Milliseconds per query

Module 9 helps you benchmark and optimize.

### My loading is slow. What can I do?

1. Use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
2. Increase batch sizes
3. Use parallel loading (Module 7)
4. Optimize transformation code
5. Add more CPU/RAM

### How do I monitor performance?

Module 11 covers monitoring:

- Structured logging
- Metrics collection
- APM integration
- Alerting rules

## Security and Privacy

### How do I handle PII data?

1. Review `steering/security-privacy.md`
2. Use environment variables for secrets
3. Never commit `.env` files
4. Encrypt backups with sensitive data
5. Follow Module 10 security hardening

### Where should I store credentials?

- Development: `.env` file (not in git)
- Production: Secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)

Never hardcode credentials in code.

### Is my data encrypted?

- At rest: Use database encryption (PostgreSQL TDE)
- In transit: Use TLS/SSL for connections
- Backups: Encrypt with GPG if needed

Module 10 covers encryption setup.

## Troubleshooting

### The MCP server isn't connecting

1. Check internet connection
2. Verify firewall allows `mcp.senzing.com` (port 443)
3. Check MCP configuration: `senzing-bootcamp/mcp.json`
4. Restart Kiro

### I'm getting error code SENZnnnn

Use the MCP tool:

```text
explain_error_code("SENZ0005")
```

Or check `docs/guides/TROUBLESHOOTING_INDEX.md`.

### My transformation code isn't working

1. Validate with `lint_record`
2. Check attribute names with `mapping_workflow`
3. Review `steering/common-pitfalls.md`
4. Use `search_docs` for attribute definitions

### The agent created files in the wrong location

Review `docs/policies/FILE_STORAGE_POLICY.md` and move files to correct locations:

- Code → `src/`
- Scripts → `scripts/`
- Data → `data/`

## Collaboration

### Can multiple people work on the same project?

Yes! Use git for collaboration:

1. Initialize git: `git init`
2. Create `.gitignore` (agent does this automatically)
3. Commit code and configuration
4. Don't commit: databases, data files, `.env`, backups

See `docs/guides/COLLABORATION_GUIDE.md` for team workflows.

### How do I share my project?

1. Backup: `./scripts/backup_project.sh`
2. Share the ZIP file
3. Recipient restores: `./scripts/restore_project.sh backup.zip`

Or use git for code sharing.
