# Module 0: Quick Demo (Optional)

## Overview

Module 0 provides a demonstration of Senzing entity resolution using sample data. This optional module is perfect for first-time users who want to see entity resolution in action before working with their own data.

This module offers multiple demo options to ensure everyone can see entity resolution working, regardless of their environment.

**Time**:

- Live Demo (SDK installed): 10-15 minutes
- Simulation Demo: 5-10 minutes (no SDK required)

**Output**: Working demo showing entity resolution results

## Prerequisites

### For Live Demo (Recommended - Real SDK)

- ✅ Module 0 complete (Senzing SDK installed)
- ✅ Python 3.8+ with senzing package

### For Simulation Demo (No SDK - Shows Concepts)

- ✅ Python 3.8+ installed
- ✅ No other requirements!

**Setup time**: Instant (no downloads)

**Note**: Simulation demo shows what Senzing would do using pre-computed results. Use this if you haven't completed Module 0 yet.

## Choosing Your Demo Path

**Recommended for most users**: Live Demo (SDK)

- ✓ Real Senzing SDK
- ✓ Actual entity resolution
- ✓ Match explanations with confidence scores
- ⏱ 10-15 minutes

**Best for quick preview**: Simulation Demo

- ✓ No SDK needed
- ✓ Instant results
- ✓ Shows concepts clearly
- ⚠ Simulation, not real SDK
- ⏱ 5-10 minutes

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- See Senzing entity resolution working in real-time
- Watch duplicate records automatically match and merge
- Understand WHY records matched (match explanations)
- Observe the before/after transformation (5 records → X entities)
- Connect the demo to your own use case

## What You'll Do

1. Choose a sample dataset (Las Vegas, London, or Moscow)
2. Review sample records showing duplicates
3. Verify Senzing SDK is available (installed in Module 0)
4. Initialize an in-memory SQLite database
5. Load sample records into Senzing
6. Query the resolved entities
7. See match explanations showing WHY records matched
8. Compare before/after (5 records → X entities)

## Sample Datasets

### Las Vegas Dataset

- **Type:** Customer records
- **Records**: ~1,000
- **Use case**: Retail/hospitality customer deduplication
- **Duplicates**: Same customers with variations in names, addresses, phones

### London Dataset

- **Type:** Person records
- **Records**: ~1,000
- **Use case**: Identity management
- **Duplicates**: Same people with name variations and different contact info

### Moscow Dataset

- **Type:** Organization records
- **Records**: ~1,000
- **Use case**: B2B vendor/supplier matching
- **Duplicates**: Same companies with different names and addresses

## Demo Script Structure

The generated demo script will:

1. **Verify Senzing SDK** - Confirms SDK is installed from Module 0
2. **Initialize Senzing** with in-memory SQLite database
3. **Load sample records** from the chosen dataset (with progress bar)
4. **Query resolved entities** to show which records matched
5. **Display match explanations** showing WHY records matched (name similarity, address match, etc.)
6. **Show statistics** (records loaded, entities created, match rate)
7. **Display example entities** with all matching records side-by-side
8. **Provide before/after comparison** (e.g., "5 records → 3 entities")

This is a real, working demonstration - not a simulation!

Key Insights:
• Senzing automatically recognized these as the same person
• No manual rules were required
• Different data formats were handled automatically
• Confidence scores show match strength
```

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### Entity Resolution

- Multiple records about the same real-world entity are identified and linked
- No manual rules required - Senzing learns from the data
- Confidence scores show match strength

### Feature Extraction

- Names, addresses, phones are parsed into features
- Features are standardized (e.g., "St" → "Street")
- Features are scored and compared

### Entity-Centric Learning

- As more records are added, resolution improves
- The engine learns patterns from your data
- No training data required

### Understanding `get_stats()` vs. Record Counts

A common pitfall: `sz_engine.get_stats()` tracks per-process workload statistics for the current engine session, not the total records in the repository. It resets after each call and may return `-1` for fields like `loadedRecords` if stats haven't accumulated. To get accurate record counts, track them during loading (e.g., increment a counter per successful `add_record` call) rather than relying on `get_stats()`. The correct use of `get_stats()` is for monitoring ongoing operations, covered in Module 9 (Performance Testing).

## File Locations

All Module 0 demo code is saved in `src/quickstart_demo/`:

```text
src/quickstart_demo/
├── demo_las_vegas.py          # Demo script for Las Vegas dataset
├── demo_london.py              # Demo script for London dataset
├── demo_moscow.py              # Demo script for Moscow dataset
├── sample_data_las_vegas.jsonl # Sample data
├── sample_data_london.jsonl    # Sample data
└── sample_data_moscow.jsonl    # Sample data
```

## Running the Demo

The demo runs automatically when you start Module 1. The agent will:

1. Verify Senzing SDK is installed (from Module 0)
2. Generate and run the demo script
3. Display results in real-time

### Manual Execution

If you want to run the demo again later:

```bash
cd src/quickstart_demo
python demo_las_vegas.py
```

## What to Look For

### Good Matches

- Same person/organization with minor variations
- Different data quality levels matched correctly
- Nicknames and abbreviations handled properly

### Interesting Cases

- Records that almost match but don't (different people with similar names)
- Records that match despite significant differences (poor data quality)
- Multiple records from same source matched together

### Statistics

- Match rate: What percentage of records are duplicates?
- Entity distribution: How many records per entity on average?
- Data quality: How consistent is the data?

## Connecting to Your Use Case

After the demo, consider:

- How does this compare to your data?
- What matching criteria matter most for you?
- What data quality issues might you have?
- How many duplicates do you expect?

## Next Steps

After completing the demo:

- **Ready to start?** → Proceed to Module 1 (Business Problem)
- **Want to try another dataset?** → Run another demo
- **Have questions?** → Ask about specific entity resolution concepts

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to install Senzing to run the demo?**
A: Yes, the SDK should be installed in Module 0. If you haven't done that yet, the simulation demo can show you the concepts without the SDK.

**Q: Does this actually run Senzing, or is it a simulation?**
A: This runs the real Senzing SDK! You'll see actual entity resolution happening, not a simulation or mock-up.

**Q: Can I use my own data for the demo?**
A: The demo uses sample data to ensure a quick, successful experience. You'll work with your data starting in Module 2.

**Q: How accurate is entity resolution?**
A: Accuracy depends on data quality. Typical match rates: 90-99% precision, 85-95% recall. The demo shows real match confidence scores.

**Q: Can I skip this module?**
A: Yes, it's optional. Skip to Module 1 if you're ready to start with your data. But we recommend the demo - it only takes 10 minutes and shows the value immediately.

## Troubleshooting Module 0

### Issue: SDK Not Found

**Symptoms**:

- "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'senzing'"
- SDK check returns "SDK not found"

**Solutions**:

1. **Complete Module 0 first** (SDK Setup)
   - Module 0 installs the SDK natively
   - Return to Module 1 after installation

2. **Use Simulation Demo** as a preview
   - Shows same concepts without SDK
   - Complete Module 0 later

3. **Check Python environment**

   ```bash
   pip list | grep senzing
   python3 -c "import senzing; print(senzing.__version__)"
   ```

---

### Issue: Database Initialization Failed

**Symptoms**:

- Error: "unable to open database file"
- Error: "SzDatabaseError - SENZ1001"

**Solutions**:

1. **Check database directory exists**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p database
   ```

2. **Check file permissions**

   ```bash
   ls -la database/
   ```

3. **Use Simulation Demo** as a fallback
   - No database required
   - Shows same concepts

---

### Issue: Demo Runs But No Matches Found

**This shouldn't happen** with sample data - the records are designed to match.

**If it does happen**:

1. **Check sample data loaded correctly**
   - Verify 5 records were loaded
   - Check for error messages during loading

2. **Verify Senzing engine initialized**
   - Look for "Engine initialized" message
   - Check for initialization errors

3. **Contact support** - This indicates a bug
   - Share error messages with agent
   - Provide full output log
   - This is unexpected behavior

---

### Issue: Want to See Real SDK, Not Simulation

**If simulation demo was used but you want to see real SDK**:

**Options**:

1. **Install Docker** and retry Docker demo
   - Follow Docker installation instructions above
   - Return to Module 0 after installation

2. **Install Senzing SDK** locally (Module 5)
   - Complete Module 5 (SDK Setup)
   - Return to Module 0 with installed SDK
   - Run native SDK demo

3. **Continue to Module 6**
   - You'll see real SDK in action
   - Module 6 loads actual data
   - More comprehensive than Module 0 demo

4. **Accept simulation for now**
   - Concepts are the same
   - Real SDK comes later
   - Focus on learning entity resolution

---

### Issue: Python Not Installed (For Simulation Demo)

**Symptoms**:

- "python: command not found"
- "python3: command not found"

**Solutions**:

1. **Install Python 3.8+**
   - **macOS**: `brew install python3` or download from [python.org](https://www.python.org)
   - **Linux**: `sudo apt install python3` (Ubuntu/Debian)
   - **Windows**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org)

2. **Verify installation**

   ```bash
   python3 --version
   # Should show: Python 3.8.x or higher
   ```

3. **Skip to Module 1**
   - Come back to Module 0 later
   - See real SDK in Module 6

---

### Issue: Module 0 Taking Longer Than Expected

**Expected times**:

- **First time (Docker)**: 15-20 minutes (includes download)
- **Subsequent runs (Docker)**: 10-15 minutes
- **Simulation Demo**: 5-10 minutes

**If taking longer**:

1. **Check what's taking time**
   - Docker image download? (2-5 minutes is normal)
   - Database initialization? (Should be <1 minute)
   - Demo execution? (Should be <2 minutes)

2. **Use Simulation Demo** for faster experience
   - Instant execution
   - No setup time
   - Same learning outcomes

3. **Continue anyway**
   - First-time setup is one-time cost
   - Subsequent runs will be faster

---

### Issue: Permission Denied Errors

**Symptoms**:

- "Permission denied" when creating files
- "Cannot write to directory"

**Causes**:

- Insufficient permissions in project directory
- Running in protected directory

**Solutions**:

1. **Check project directory permissions**

   ```bash
   ls -la
   ```

2. **Move to user directory**

   ```bash
   # Create project in home directory
   cd ~
   mkdir my-senzing-project
   cd my-senzing-project
   ```

3. **Fix permissions** (if needed)

   ```bash
   chmod 755 .
   ```

---

### Getting Help

**If none of these solutions work**:

1. **Try Simulation Demo**
   - Guaranteed to work
   - No dependencies
   - Shows same concepts

2. **Share error messages with agent**
   - Copy full error output
   - Describe what you tried
   - Agent can provide specific guidance
